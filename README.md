# PIMA_Diabetes_Prediction
PIMA Indian (Native American) Diabetes Prediction Dataset 
This is a quick binary classification problem using the PIMA Indians diabetes dataset. This is a supervised machine learning problem with eight input variables and one output variable. 

I will walk through loading the dataset, data-cleaning, and data visualizations. Next up will be feature engineering;  a yeo-johnson transformation will be done to normalize features. Finally, classic machine learning models will be compared using model performance metrics.
